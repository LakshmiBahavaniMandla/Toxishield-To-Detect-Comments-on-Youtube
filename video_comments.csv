The meat inside is tender, juicy, and full of flavor, creating the perfect balance between crispiness and softness. The taste is rich, with a slight spiciness or creaminess, depending on the type, making each bite irresistible. Every time you bite, your taste buds are awakened by the blend of seasonings.
